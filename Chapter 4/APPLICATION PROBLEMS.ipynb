    "Before an automobile parts manufacturer takes full delivery of polymer resins made by a supplier in a reactive extrusion process, a sample is processed and the performance is tested for `Toughness`. The batch is either accepted (if the processed sample's `Toughness` equals or exceeds 140 $J/m^3$) or it is rejected. As a result of process and raw material variability, the acceptance/rejection status of each batch varies randomly.  If the supplier sends four batches weekly to the parts manufacturer, and each batch is made independently on the extrusion process, so that the ultimate fate of one batch is independent of the fate of any other batch, define $X$ as the random variable representing the number of acceptable batches a week and answer the following questions:\n",
