    "Before an automobile parts manufacturer takes full delivery of polymer resins made by a supplier in a reactive extrusion process, a sample is processed and the performance is tested for `Toughness`.

As a result of process and raw material variability, the acceptance/rejection status of each batch varies randomly.
