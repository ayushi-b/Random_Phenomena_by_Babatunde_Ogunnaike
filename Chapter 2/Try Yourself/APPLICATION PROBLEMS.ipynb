    "In the summer of 1943 during World War II, a total of 365 warships were attacked by Kamikaze pilots: 180 took evasive action and 60 of these were hit; the remaining  185 counterattacked, of which 62 were hit. Using a relative frequency interpretation and invoking any other assumption you deem necessary, determine the probability that any attacked warship will be hit regardless of tactical response. Also determine the probability that a warship taking evasive action will be hit and the probability that a counterattacking warship will be hit.  Compare these three probabilities and discuss what this implies regarding choosing an appropriate tactical response. (A full discussion of this problem is contained in Chapter 7.)"
